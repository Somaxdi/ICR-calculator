# ICR calculator
ICR calculator is a simple CR (Challenge Rating) calculator for homebrew D&D monsters based purely on their main stats, damage vulnerabilities, etc. without taking into calculation their actions. So it is not the most precise but it will be improved in future releases. It is trained with all the monsters up to Keys from the Golden Vault
